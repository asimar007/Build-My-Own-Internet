  "description": "This project is an AI agent that can build and create websites from simple text-based commands. This tool leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and execute terminal commands, effectively acting as an AI web developer.\n\nThe core of this project is a tool that can execute any terminal or shell command provided by an LLM. This allows the AI to perform tasks like creating directories, adding files, and writing code, thus building a complete website from a single command. The project demonstrates a practical application of AI agents in automating web development tasks.",
