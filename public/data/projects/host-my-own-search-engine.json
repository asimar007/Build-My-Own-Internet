  "tagline": "Crawl, index, and rank the web with a custom-built search engine.",
  "description": "This project is a self-hosted, privacy-focused search engine powered by SearXNG â€“ a free and open-source metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others without tracking users or building user profiles. It aims to break the monopoly of ad-driven search engines and help reclaim user privacy.",
  "audience": "Privacy-conscious users and developers interested in self-hosted solutions",
  "problem": "Traditional search engines track user behavior, build profiles, and monetize data through targeted ads. How can we search the web privately without being tracked or profiled?",
  "features": [
    "No tracking, no profiling, no logs",
    "Aggregates results from 70+ search engines (Google, Bing, Wikipedia, Reddit, etc.)",
    "Easy Docker-based deployment on cloud infrastructure",
    "Optional proxy setup for anonymous IP addresses",
    "HTTPS enabled with Let's Encrypt certificates",

    },
    {
      "q": "How does it protect privacy?",
      "a": "SearXNG doesn't track users, store search queries, or build user profiles. It acts as a proxy between you and other search engines, keeping your searches anonymous."
    },
    {
      "q": "What search engines does it use?",
      "a": "SearXNG aggregates results from 70+ search engines including Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, Reddit, and many others."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I make my IP address anonymous?",
      "a": "Yes, you can configure SearXNG to use a proxy server so that requests to other search engines are made via the proxy rather than your actual IP address."
